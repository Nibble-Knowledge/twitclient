## Contribute

If you are a member of Oysttyer you already have commit access. It is expected you will have been running your changes locally before pushing to here, but apart from that, go for it!

### You already have code or an idea for code you want to contribute

- Fork the project
- Make your additions/fixes/improvements
- Run you code locally and make sure your changes work and you've not broken anything
- Send a pull request

### You don't already have code, nor any ideas for code, but still want to contribute code somehow:

- Have a look through issues labelled "easier" or "harder" depending on how ambitious you are feeling. I am trying to ensure all relevant issues have one of those labels.
- Then run through the steps as per above
- Feel free to link to your fork in the issue before submitting a pull request if you want a review
- Or just open the pull request. A pull request doesn't have to start with the finished code

### You have ideas/bugs:

- Just open an issue with ideas for features or bugs you have found

## Useful tools for developers

See the oysttyer-dev repo. For now there is just one extension that can provide a full json dump of a tweet. It is very useful for inspecting the structure of a tweet per the API. Any further ideas or extensions, etc to help with developing are welcome there.

## Testing

There are no tests! :(

I'm not necessarily the world's biggest fan of unit tests, but some tests would certainly be nice. So one great contribution would be ideas or a start on adding some kind of tests.
